Ass tutorial for npc's.

(you need 2 accounts to use this)

1. Step : Goto Bull

2. Step : get your alt and knock it with your main and drag it at the head

3. Step : basically remove your alts arm by executing this (execute it on the account ur dragging your acc with)

    local args = {
        [1] = "Grabbing",
        [2] = true
    }
 
    game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("MainEvent"):FireServer(unpack(args))

task.wait(0.1)


local Alt = "ALTSUSERNAME"

game.Players[Alt].Character.RightUpperArm.Position = Vector3.new(0,-1200,0)

4. Step : after you've done it sit down with your main on the Bull and execute this on your alt (after your alt isnt knocked anymore)


if game.Players.LocalPlayer.Name == "altaccountyouremovedarmfrom" then
    game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame = game.Players.accountyouwantgodmodeon.Character.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame * CFrame.new(0,0,-2)
    local person = "accountyouwantgodmodeon"
    game.Players[person].Character.BodyEffects["K.O"]:GetPropertyChangedSignal("Value"):Wait()
    if game.Players[person].Character:FindFirstChild("GRABBING_CONSTRAINT") then
    else
    wait(0.3)
    game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame = CFrame.new(game.Players[person].Character.UpperTorso.Position.X,game.Players[person].Character.UpperTorso.Position.Y,game.Players[person].Character.UpperTorso.Position.Z) * CFrame.new(0,1,0)
    task.wait(0.2)
    local args = {
        [1] = "Grabbing",
        [2] = true
    }
 
    game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("MainEvent"):FireServer(unpack(args))
    end
    wait(0.7)
    if game.Players[person].Character:FindFirstChild("GRABBING_CONSTRAINT") then
    game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame = CFrame.new(0, -499, 0)
    end
    end

After you have executed it on your alt basically do nothing on your accounts just wait till it drops you off the bull
after it drops you off the bull the alt is basically gonna tp on you and carry you to give you "GRABBING_CONSTRAINT" (the "godmode/antiknock")

After all that happend try to use tools and if you cant use any tools you got godmode. 

If it didnt work the first try basically re-execute the carry script and sit on bull again till it works :D
